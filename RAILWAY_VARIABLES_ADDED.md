## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1️⃣ Verify All Variables Are Added

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on your service "giving-determination"
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Verify you see **12 variables total**:
   - 4 Azure OpenAI variables
   - 3 Jira variables
   - 1 Figma variable
   - 4 Configuration variables

### 2️⃣ Wait for Deployment

- Railway will automatically redeploy with new variables
- Go to **"Deployments"** tab
- Monitor the build progress
- Wait for: ✅ **"Deploy successful"**
- Build time: 3-5 minutes

### 3️⃣ Check Deployment Logs

While deploying, check logs for:
- ✅ "✅ TestGenie initialized successfully"
- ✅ "✅ EpicRoast initialized successfully"
- ✅ "✅ GroomRoom initialized successfully"
- ✅ "✅ JiraIntegration initialized successfully"

### 4️⃣ Get Your Backend URL

Once deployment succeeds:
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"** or **"Domains"** section
3. Copy your Railway URL
4. It will look like: `https://giving-determination-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

**SAVE THIS URL - You'll need it for Vercel!**

### 5️⃣ Test Backend Health Endpoint

Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "testgenie": true,
    "epicroast": true,
    "groomroom": true,
    "jira": true
  }
}
```

### 6️⃣ Test Jira Integration (Optional)

If Jira is configured, test fetching a ticket:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/jira/ticket/ODCD-34544
```

Should return ticket information in JSON format.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs:**
   - Go to Deployments → Latest → View Logs
   - Look for error messages

2. **Common Issues:**
   - **Missing variables:** Verify all 12 variables are added
   - **Azure OpenAI errors:** Check endpoint URL ends with `/`
   - **Jira errors:** Check URL has NO trailing `/`
   - **Import errors:** Check requirements.txt has all packages

3. **Verify Variable Names:**
   - All names must be EXACTLY as shown (case-sensitive)
   - No extra spaces
   - No quotes around values

### If Health Check Fails:

1. **503 Service Unavailable:**
   - Backend is still starting up
   - Wait 30 seconds and try again
   - Railway free tier has cold starts

2. **Azure OpenAI Service Error:**
   - Check API key is valid
   - Verify endpoint URL is correct
   - Check deployment name matches (o4-mini)

3. **Jira Integration False:**
   - Check Jira credentials
   - Verify API token hasn't expired
   - Test Jira URL is accessible

---

## ✅ Once Backend is Healthy

When health endpoint returns "healthy" status:

1. ✅ Copy your Railway backend URL
2. ✅ Test a few endpoints to confirm everything works
3. ➡️ Proceed to Vercel frontend deployment
4. 📄 See: `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`
