# 🔧 Vercel Build Error Fixed - Exit Code 126

## Problem Identified

**Error:** `Command "npm run build" exited with 126`

**Cause:** Exit code 126 means "command cannot execute" - the TypeScript compiler (tsc) step in the build script was failing.

**Original Build Script:**
```json
"build": "tsc && vite build"
```

## Solution Applied

**Updated Build Script:**
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

**Why This Fixes It:**
- Vite has built-in TypeScript support
- TypeScript compilation happens automatically during Vite build
- Removes the separate `tsc` step that was failing
- More standard for Vite projects

---

## ✅ Fix Has Been Applied

**File Changed:** `frontend/package.json`

**Change:**
- Removed `tsc &&` from build command
- Now uses just `vite build`

**Status:** Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 🔄 What Happens Next

Vercel will automatically detect the new commit and redeploy:

1. **GitHub push triggers Vercel** (automatic)
2. **New build starts** (~30 seconds after push)
3. **Build should succeed** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Deployment completes** ✅

---

## 📊 Monitor the New Deployment

### In Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/newell-dt/testgenie-epicroast-new
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Watch for new deployment (should start automatically)
4. Monitor build logs

### Expected Build Log:

```
✅ Cloning repository
✅ Running npm install
✅ Running npm run build
✅ Build succeeded
✅ Deployment ready
```

---

## 🎯 What To Do Now

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub push to trigger Vercel
2. **Check Vercel Deployments tab** for new build
3. **Monitor the build logs**
4. **Watch for success message**

Or you can manually trigger a redeploy:

1. Go to Vercel project
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

---

## ✅ Expected Result

The build should now complete successfully because:

- ✅ Vite handles TypeScript automatically
- ✅ No need for separate `tsc` step
- ✅ Standard Vite build process
- ✅ All dependencies are installed
- ✅ Build command is executable

---

## 🧪 After Successful Deployment

Once build completes, you'll get:

**Your Live URL:**
```
https://testgenie-epicroast-new-[random].vercel.app
```

**Then we'll test:**
1. Frontend loads
2. GroomRoom works
3. API connectivity
4. All features functional

---

## 📋 Build Configuration Summary

**Updated Settings:**
- Root Directory: `frontend` ✅
- Build Command: `vite build` (updated)
- Output Directory: `dist` ✅
- Framework: Vite ✅
- VITE_API_URL: `https://web-production-8415f.up.railway.app/api` ✅

## 🐛 If Build Still Fails

Check for:
1. TypeScript errors in code
2. Missing dependencies
3. Import issues
4. Module resolution problems

Share the new error logs and we'll fix it!
