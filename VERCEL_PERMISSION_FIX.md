# 🔧 Vercel Permission Error Fixed - Exit Code 126

## Error Details

**Error Message:**
```
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/frontend/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126
```

**Cause:** Permission denied on the vite executable in node_modules/.bin/

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Use npx Instead of Direct Binary

**Updated Build Command:**
```json
"build": "npx vite build"
```

**Why this works:**
- `npx` handles permissions correctly
- Runs binaries from node_modules with proper execution rights
- Standard approach for Vercel deployments

---

## 🔄 Additional Fix: Clear Build Cache

**You should also clear Vercel's build cache:**

### In Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to your project: https://vercel.com/newell-dt/testgenie-epicroast-new
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Scroll to **"Build & Development Settings"**
4. Find **"Build Cache"** section
5. Click **"Clear Build Cache"**
6. Confirm the action

### Then Redeploy:

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"..."** on latest deployment  
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** should be OFF (since we cleared it)

---

## 📊 Changes Made

**File:** `frontend/package.json`

**Before:**
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

**After:**
```json
"build": "npx vite build"
```

**Status:** ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 🎯 Action Required

### Step 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy

Vercel should auto-detect the new commit and redeploy (1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Clear Build Cache (Recommended)

Follow the steps above to clear Vercel build cache

### Step 3: Manual Redeploy (If Needed)

If auto-deploy doesn't work:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click "..." on failed deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

---

## ✅ Expected Result

Build should now succeed:

```
✅ Cloning completed
✅ npm install completed
✅ npx vite build
✅ Building for production...
✅ Build completed
✅ Deployment ready
```

---

## 🐛 If Still Failing

Try these additional steps:

### Option 1: Override Build Command in Vercel

1. Go to Settings → General
2. Find "Build & Development Settings"
3. Override "Build Command" with: `npx vite build`
4. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Check Node Modules

The issue might be with how dependencies are installed. Try:
1. Clear build cache (as described above)
2. Fresh redeploy
3. Check if all dependencies install correctly

### Option 3: Verify Vite Installation

In package.json, vite should be in dependencies:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "vite": "^7.0.5"
}
```

(Currently it is, so this should be fine)

## 💡 Why Exit Code 126?

Exit code 126 means "Cannot execute":
- **First attempt:** Command not found or not executable
- **This attempt:** Permission denied on the binary

Using `npx` solves both issues by:
- Finding the correct binary path
- Executing with proper permissions
- Standard Node.js package execution

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for Vercel to detect new commit
2. **Go to Settings** and clear build cache (recommended)
3. **Check Deployments tab** for new build
4. **Monitor build logs**
5. **If succeeds:** Get your live URL! 🎉
6. **If fails:** Share new error logs
